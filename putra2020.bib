ABSTRACT="Sundanese is the second-largest tribe in Indonesia which possesses many
dialects. This condition has gained attention for many researchers to
analyze emotion especially on social media. However, with barely available
Sundanese dataset, this condition makes understanding sundanese emotion is
a challenging task. In this research, we proposed a dataset for emotion
classification of Sundanese text. The preprocessing includes case folding,
stopwords removal, stemming, tokenizing, and text representation. Prior to
classification, for the feature generation, we utilize term
frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF). We evaluated our dataset
using k-Fold Cross Validation. Our experiments with the proposed method
exhibit an effective result for machine learning classification.
Furthermore, as far as we know, this is the first Sundanese emotion dataset
available for public."
